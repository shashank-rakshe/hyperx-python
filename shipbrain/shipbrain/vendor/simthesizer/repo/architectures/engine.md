# Event Engine Architecture

## Purpose

The engine owns virtual time and execution order. It knows three node kinds
and nothing about requests, batches, or models.

## Graph

The event graph is a DAG of nodes and dependency edges. A node becomes ready
when every predecessor has completed, and starts at the later of its own
release time and its last predecessor's finish.

- A **compute node** holds one layer descriptor, one batch of per-request
  `(q_len, kv_len, lm_head_len)` states, and optional runner context. Its
  compute simulator returns its latency.
- A **network node** holds one point-to-point transfer `(src, dst, bytes)`.
  Its network simulator is polled until the transfer completes.
- A **logical node** holds an opaque payload for one owning handler. The
  handler returns a latency and may mutate the graph.

Payloads are private to their owner. The engine never inspects them, so new
behavior needs no engine change.

## Execution

Ready nodes run in `(start time, node ID)` order. Node IDs increase with
creation, so ties resolve by creation order and runs are deterministic.
Release times and latencies must be finite and nonnegative; pending network
polls must advance representable time.

A completed node releases its children and is removed. The run ends when no
node is ready; any node left in the graph means a cycle or an orphan, and the
run fails.

A network poll answers either complete or pending with a delay. A pending node
requeues itself after that delay, which lets concurrent transfers change each
other's rates. Polls reach a simulator in nondecreasing time, so it may advance
its own clock lazily.

## Graph Mutation

Only a running logical handler mutates the graph, in two ways:

- add nodes beneath the running node;
- detach the running node's outgoing edges and reattach those children beneath
  newly added work.

Detach and reattach splice dynamic work into a pre-seeded DAG: a static
dependency survives, but its target now also waits for work that did not exist
when it was seeded.

Initially ready nodes are collected once, before execution. A node created at
run time with no path from the running node never runs and fails the run as a
leftover.

## Ownership and Safety

Nodes reference their handler or simulator by raw pointer. This is sound
because:

- every handler and simulator lives in the boxed config tree, which is neither
  moved nor restructured after initialization;
- execution is single-threaded, so handler and simulator calls never overlap.

## Evolution Rules

Read-only observation callbacks run after each timestamp has drained, including
zero-duration descendants. The engine does not interpret the component state or
choose a storage format; see [observability](observability.md).

- Express new semantics as logical nodes owned by a component, not as new node
  kinds.
- Return a latency or add nodes; never advance time from a component.
- Parallel execution first requires an ownership model that replaces the raw
  pointers.
